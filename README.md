# Vuello

Vuello is a minimal clone of [Trello](https://trello.com/) built using Vue.js. The app is developed by following the [Vue Mastery's](https://www.vuemastery.com/) - 'Watch Us Build a Trello Clone'. Working part of the app is mostly identical to the one taught in course, but the UI is changed and made using [Vuetify 2](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/).
